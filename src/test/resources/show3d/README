This directory contains the source code for a small Processing
application that can read the generated Mapcode rererence files.

You can download Processing from: http://processing.org

Make sure the test files are generated with (x, y, z) coordinate
information (e.g. "mapcode -gXYZ 1000", rather than "mapcode -g 1000").
